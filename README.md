# Integrating uncertainty in deep neural networks for MRI based stroke analysis

This repository contains the code to the paper "Integrating Uncertainty in Deep Neural Networks for MRI based stroke analysis" (available online on [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841520301547?dgcid=rss_sd_all](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841520301547?dgcid=rss_sd_all) and [https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06332](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06332))

The analysis framework comprises two parts:
- CNNs for image classification (image_classfication)
- FC-NNs and 1D-CNNs combining the image predictions to a patient-level classification (patient_classification)
