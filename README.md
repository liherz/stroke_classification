# stroke_classification

This repository contains the code to the paper "Integrating Uncertainty in Deep Neural Networks for MRI based stroke analysis".

The analysis framework comprises two parts:
- CNNs for image classification (image_classfication)
- FC-NNs and 1D-CNNs combining the image predictions to a patient-level classification (patient_classification)
